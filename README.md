# Semi-Supervised-Clustering
Here we attempt to develop a practically implementable algorithm for massive data sets . The kmeans() algorithm  is used ass a foundation and a semi supervised learning approach is taken to cluster huge data sets,. Main goal is to perform color quantization of massive images.
